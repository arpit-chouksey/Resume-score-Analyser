# 📄 Resume Score Analyzer

A React-based web application that analyzes resumes (PDF format) and provides a **mocked resume score with improvement suggestions**.  
This project focuses on **frontend architecture, UI/UX, validation, and state management**, simulating how an AI-powered resume analyzer would work.
